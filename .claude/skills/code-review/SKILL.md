# Code Review Workflow Skill

## Context (Input)

- PR has unresolved code review comments
- Need systematic approach to address feedback
- Ready to implement reviewer suggestions

## Task (Function)

Retrieve PR comments, categorize by type, and implement all changes systematically.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Get PR Comments

```bash
make pr-comments              # Auto-detect from current branch
make pr-comments PR=62       # Specify PR number
make pr-comments FORMAT=json  # JSON output
```

**Output**: All unresolved comments with file/line, author, timestamp, URL

### Step 2: Categorize Comments

| Type                   | Identifier                  | Priority | Action                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Committable Suggestion | Code block, "```suggestion" | Highest  | Apply immediately, commit separately |
| LLM Prompt             | "🤖 Prompt for AI Agents"   | High     | Execute prompt, implement changes    |
| Question               | Ends with "?"               | Medium   | Answer inline or via code change     |
| General Feedback       | Discussion, recommendation  | Low      | Consider and improve                 |

### Step 3: Apply Changes Systematically

#### For Committable Suggestions

1. Apply code change exactly as suggested
2. Commit with reference:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Apply review suggestion: [brief description]

   Ref: [comment URL]"
   ```

#### For LLM Prompts

1. Copy prompt from comment
2. Execute as instructed
3. Verify output meets requirements
4. Commit with reference

#### For Questions

1. Determine if code change or reply needed
2. If code: implement + commit
3. If reply: respond on GitHub

#### For Feedback

1. Evaluate suggestion merit
2. Implement if beneficial
3. Document reasoning if declined

### Step 4: Verify All Addressed

```bash
make pr-comments  # Should show zero unresolved comments
```

### Step 5: Run Quality Checks

```bash
make ci  # Must show "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"
```

## Comment Resolution Workflow

```mermaid
PR Comments → Categorize → Apply by Priority → Verify → Run CI → Done
```

## Constraints (Parameters)

**NEVER**:

- Skip committable suggestions
- Batch unrelated changes in one commit
- Ignore LLM prompts from reviewers
- Commit without running `make ci`
- Leave questions unanswered

**ALWAYS**:

- Apply suggestions exactly as provided
- Commit each suggestion separately with URL reference
- Run `make ci` after implementing changes
- Mark conversations resolved after addressing

## Format (Output)

**Commit Message Template**:

```
Apply review suggestion: [concise description]

[Optional: explanation if non-obvious]

Ref: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/XX#discussion_rYYYYYYY
```

**Final Verification**:

```bash
✅ make pr-comments shows 0 unresolved
✅ make ci shows "CI checks successfully passed!"
```
