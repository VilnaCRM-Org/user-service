# Code Review Workflow Skill

## Context (Input)

- PR has unresolved code review comments
- Need systematic approach to address feedback
- Ready to implement reviewer suggestions
- Need to maintain quality standards during review implementation

## Task (Function)

Systematically retrieve, categorize, and address all PR code review comments while maintaining quality standards.

**Success Criteria**: `make pr-comments` shows 0 unresolved AND `make ci` shows "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"

## Workflow Overview

```mermaid
AI Review Loop → PR Comments → Categorize → Apply by Priority → Verify → Run CI → Done
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Run autonomous AI review + fix loop (Codex default, Claude optional)
make ai-review-loop

# 1. Get comments
make pr-comments

# 2. Apply each suggestion/fix (one commit per comment)
git commit -m "Apply review suggestion: [description]

Ref: [comment URL]"

# 3. Verify all addressed
make pr-comments  # Should show 0 unresolved

# 4. Run CI
make ci  # Must show "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Run Autonomous AI Review Loop

Before addressing PR comments manually, run the autonomous review loop:

```bash
make ai-review-loop
```

This executes `scripts/ai-review-loop.sh`, which:
1. Runs an AI review agent against the current diff (base: `main` by default)
2. If issues are found (`STATUS: FAIL`), runs a fix agent to auto-remediate
3. Verifies fixes with `make ci`
4. Repeats up to `AI_REVIEW_MAX_ITER` times (default: 3)

**Configuration** (all overridable via environment):

| Variable              | Default                              | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `AI_REVIEW_AGENTS`    | `codex`                              | Agent(s) to use (`codex`, `claude`)   |
| `AI_REVIEW_BASE`      | `main`                               | Base branch for diff comparison       |
| `AI_REVIEW_MAX_ITER`  | `3`                                  | Max review/fix iterations (0=∞)       |
| `AI_REVIEW_VERIFY_CMD`| `make ci`                            | Verification command after each fix   |
| `AI_REVIEW_LOG_DIR`   | `var/ai-review`                      | Directory for review/fix logs         |

**Examples**:

```bash
# Use Claude instead of Codex
AI_REVIEW_AGENTS=claude make ai-review-loop

# Limit to 1 iteration, custom base branch
AI_REVIEW_BASE=develop AI_REVIEW_MAX_ITER=1 make ai-review-loop

# Run both agents
AI_REVIEW_AGENTS=codex,claude make ai-review-loop
```

**Prompt templates**: `scripts/ai-review-prompts/review.md` (reviewer) and `scripts/ai-review-prompts/fix.md` (fixer).

### Step 1: Get PR Comments

```bash
make pr-comments              # Auto-detect from current branch
make pr-comments PR=62       # Specify PR number
make pr-comments FORMAT=json  # JSON output
```

**Output**: All unresolved comments with file/line, author, timestamp, URL

### Step 2: Categorize Comments

| Type                   | Identifier                  | Priority | Action                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Committable Suggestion | Code block, "```suggestion" | Highest  | Apply immediately, commit separately |
| LLM Prompt             | "🤖 Prompt for AI Agents"   | High     | Execute prompt, implement changes    |
| Architecture Concern   | Class naming, file location | High     | Invoke appropriate skill             |
| Question               | Ends with "?"               | Medium   | Answer inline or via code change     |
| General Feedback       | Discussion, recommendation  | Low      | Consider and improve                 |

### Step 3: Verify Architecture & Organization

For code changes (suggestions, prompts, new files), invoke verification skills:

| Concern Type           | Skill to Invoke                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Class placement/naming | `code-organization`                |
| DDD patterns           | `implementing-ddd-architecture`    |
| Layer violations       | `deptrac-fixer` (if deptrac fails) |

**Quick verification**: Run `make phpcsfixer && make psalm && make deptrac && make unit-tests`

### Step 4: Apply Changes Systematically

#### For Committable Suggestions

1. Apply code change exactly as suggested
2. Commit with reference:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Apply review suggestion: [brief description]

   Ref: [comment URL]"
   ```

#### For LLM Prompts

1. Copy prompt from comment
2. Execute as instructed
3. Verify output meets requirements
4. Commit with reference

#### For Architecture/Organization Concerns

1. Invoke appropriate skill (`code-organization` or `implementing-ddd-architecture`)
2. Implement recommended changes
3. Verify: `make phpcsfixer && make psalm && make deptrac && make unit-tests`
4. Commit with reference

#### For Questions

1. Determine if code change or reply needed
2. If code: implement + commit
3. If reply: respond on GitHub

#### For General Feedback

1. Evaluate suggestion merit
2. Implement if beneficial
3. Document reasoning if declined

### Step 5: Verify All Addressed

```bash
make pr-comments  # Should show zero unresolved comments
```

### Step 6: Run Quality Checks

**MANDATORY**: Run comprehensive CI checks after implementing all changes:

```bash
make ci  # Must output "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"
```

**If CI fails**, invoke appropriate skill:

| Failure Type            | Skill to Use            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Architecture violations | `deptrac-fixer`         |
| Complexity issues       | `complexity-management` |
| Test failures           | `testing-workflow`      |
| Mutation testing issues | `testing-workflow`      |
| Code style              | Run `make phpcsfixer`   |
| Static analysis         | Run `make psalm`        |

**DO NOT** finish the task until `make ci` shows: `✅ CI checks successfully passed!`

## Constraints (Parameters)

**NEVER**:

- Skip the autonomous AI review loop (`make ai-review-loop`) without justification
- Skip committable suggestions
- Batch unrelated changes in one commit
- Ignore LLM prompts from reviewers
- Commit without running verification
- Leave questions unanswered
- Accept organizational violations (invoke `code-organization` skill)
- Accept architecture violations (invoke `implementing-ddd-architecture` skill)
- Finish task before `make ci` shows success message

**ALWAYS**:

- Run `make ai-review-loop` before manually addressing PR comments
- Apply suggestions exactly as provided
- Commit each suggestion separately with URL reference
- Invoke `code-organization` skill for structural issues
- Invoke `implementing-ddd-architecture` skill for DDD violations
- Run `make ci` after implementing all changes
- Address ALL CI failures before finishing
- Mark conversations resolved after addressing

## Format (Output)

**Commit Message Template**:

```
Apply review suggestion: [concise description]

[Optional: explanation if non-obvious]

Ref: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/XX#discussion_rYYYYYYY
```

**Final Verification**:

```bash
✅ make pr-comments shows 0 unresolved
✅ make ci shows "CI checks successfully passed!"
```
