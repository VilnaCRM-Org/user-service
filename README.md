## Possibilities

- A lot of CI checks to ensure the highest code quality that can be
  (Security checks, Code style fixer, static linters, DeepScan, Snyk)
- Configured testing tools: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- This template is based on [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/tree/master)
- Much more!

## Why you might need it

Many front-end developers need to create new projects from scratch and spend a lot of time.

We decided to simplify this exhausting process and create a public template for modern
front-end applications. This template is used for all our microservices in VilnaCRM.
