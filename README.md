## Documentation
Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/user-service/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/user-service/wiki/Community-and-Support) as it's frequently updated.

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) installed.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vilnacrm), and before you ask a question, [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/user-service/wiki/Community-and-Support).

## Tests
[Tests](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/user-service/tree/main/tests/) use PHPUnit 9 and [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat).

[Test status](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/user-service/actions)

If this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?
