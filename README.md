## Possibilities
- Modern PHP stack for services: [API Platform 3](https://api-platform.com/), PHP 8, [Symfony 6](https://symfony.com/)
- [Hexagonal Architecture, DDD & CQRS in PHP](https://github.com/CodelyTV/php-ddd-example)
- Built-in docker environment and convenient `make` cli command
- A lot of CI checks to ensure the highest code quality that can be ([Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), [PHPInsights](https://phpinsights.com/), Security checks, Code style fixer)
- Configured testing tools: [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), [Behat](https://docs.behat.org/)
- Much more!

## Why you might need it
Many PHP developers need to create new projects from scratch and spend a lot of time. 

We decided to simplify this exhausting process and create a public template for modern PHP applications. This template is used for all our microservices in VilnaCRM.

## License

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/blob/main/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

### Minimal installation
You can clone this repository locally or use Github functionality "Use this template"

Install the latest [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Use `make` command to set up project and automatically install all needed dependencies
> make start

Go to browser and open the link below
> https://localhost/api/docs

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHP service template!

## Using
You can use `make` command to easily control and work with project locally.

Execute `make` or `make help` to see the full list of project commands.

The list of the `make` possibilities:

## Documentation
Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) installed.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vilnacrm), and before you ask a question, [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests
[Tests](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/tree/main/tests/) use PHPUnit 9 and [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat).

[![Test status](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/actions)

If this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?

## Security
